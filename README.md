Further, COnvex Hull was generated by querying the coordinates using PostgreSQL-PostGIS extension. 
Two polygons were generated from the given coordinates of the locations and verified visually if they were Disjoint. 
An Epitrochoid curve was generated using JavaScript keeping one of the locations (OHE-122) as the center.
